Note to self:

When updating laravel to laravel 5.2 and blade isn't working
composer require laravelcollective/html

Use the laravelcollective/html package instead of illuminate/html going forward.

How to change over cleanly:

First, comment out the references to Illuminate\Html in your config/app.php. (Don't remove them, you're going to change them in a minute.)

Next, do composer remove illuminate/html.

After that, do composer require laravelcollective/html.

Now uncomment the Illuminate\Html items in your config/app.php file and update references to Collective\Html instead of Illuminate\Html.

If it works, you might get an error "Undefined variable: errors (view ... path to view). In which case, update your routes.php file to use the new 'web' middleware.

Route::group(['middleware' => ['web']], function () use ($router) { $router->resource('whatever', 'WhateverController'); });
