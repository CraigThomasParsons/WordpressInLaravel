# WordpressInLaravel
This is a website for a photographer. Wordpress is used for the backend and dataentry.

Going to jot down a short todolist for myself here:
- Need to figure out what version of wordpress I was using all those years ago.
- Need to see if this code can even run at all
- Install wordpress and write out the instructions properly to get it to integrate with this.
- After all that see about setting up docker files and docker-compose that can set up an easy development environment.
